# Assignment 01 – Python Practice Problems

## Problem 1: Monthly Budget Analyzer
Calculates total monthly expenses under Rent, Food, Transport, and Utilities.  
Logic: Added expenses and checked if total is within PKR 60,000 using an `if` statement.  
Challenges: None, straightforward arithmetic and conditional logic.

## Problem 2: Electricity Bill Estimator
Determines billing category based on units consumed.  
Logic: Took user input and used `if–elif–else` to categorize units: Basic (≤100), Standard (101–300), High Usage (>300).  
Challenges: Converting input from string to integer.

## Problem 3: Class Attendance Analysis
Counts students meeting attendance requirement (≥75%) and those who do not.  
Logic: Used a `for` loop with counters and `if` condition inside the loop.  
Challenges: None, simple iteration and counting.

## Problem 4: Scholarship Eligibility System
Finds students eligible for scholarship based on CGPA ≥3.5 and income ≤80,000 PKR.  
Logic: Iterated through CGPA and income lists using `zip()`, applied compound condition `and`, and counted eligible students.  
Challenges: Understanding how to check two conditions together.

## Problem 5: Sensor Alert System (Bonus)
Identifies readings outside safe range (20–80), counts alerts, and calculates alert percentage.  
Logic: Used loop and `if` condition, maintained counter, and calculated percentage at the end.  
Challenges: Making sure the percentage calculation was correct.
