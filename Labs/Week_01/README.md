# Python Practice Exercises

## Overview
This repository contains simple Python programs to practice basic programming concepts like variables, loops, and conditional logic. These exercises help build foundational skills for AI/ML workflows.

## Included Problems
1. **Monthly Budget Analyzer** – Calculates total expenses and checks if within budget.  
2. **Electricity Bill Estimator** – Determines billing category based on units consumed.  
3. **Class Attendance Analysis** – Counts students meeting or not meeting attendance requirements.  
4. **Scholarship Eligibility System** – Finds students eligible for scholarship based on CGPA and income.  
5. **Sensor Alert System (Bonus)** – Detects readings outside safe range and calculates alert percentage.  

## Key Concepts Practiced
- Variables and arithmetic operations  
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Loops and counters  
- Compound conditions (`and`)  
- Simple data analysis  

## Usage
- Open the `.py` file for the problem you want to run.  
- Execute it in Python 3.x environment.  
- Observe the outputs and learn from the results.  

*These exercises reinforce structured thinking and basic programming skills for AI/ML.*
